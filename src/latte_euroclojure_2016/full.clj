;;; # Types, really?


;;; ### Example: the (type-generic) identity function


(term
 (λ [A :type] (λ [x A] x))
  ;; ^^^ (fn [x] x) in LaTTe ^^^
)





;;; # Let's do some type-checking ...

(type-check?

 ;; the lambda-term:

 (λ [A :type]
   (λ [x A] x))

 ;; is of type ...

 (∀ [A :type]
  (==> A A)))



;;; # The type-generic composition function
;; in Clojure: ((fn [f] (fn [g] (fn [x] (g (f x))))))

(type-check?

  ;; the lambda-term:

 (λ [A B C :type]
   (λ [f (==> A B)]
     (λ [g (==> B C)]
       (λ [x A]
         (g (f x))))))

 ;; is of type ...

 (∀ [A B C :type]
  (==> (==> A B)
       (==> B C)
       (==> A C))))



;;; # Deduction ...

;;; Logical (and thus mathematical) reasoning heavily relies on
;;; a simple albeit powerful law: <<<modus ponens|||(lambda (x) t)>>>
;; (a.k.a. detachment, cut, resolution, etc.)

;;; ### if we know that "A implies B"
;;; ### and if it is the case that "A holds"
;;; ### ... then we can deduce that "B holds" also.

(type-check?
 [A :type] [B :type]

 ;; find a term ...
 (λ [f (==> A B)]
    (λ [x A]
       (f x)))
 
 ;; of type
 
 (==> (==> A B) A
      B))



;;; # Universal quantifier

;;; In type theory, the modus ponens naturally generalizes
;;; to instantiation of universal quantifiers.

(type-check?
 [Thing :type] [man (==> Thing :type)] [mortal (==> Thing :type)]
 [socrates Thing]

 (λ [H1 (∀ [t Thing]
         (==> (man t) (mortal t)))]
    (λ [H2 (man socrates)]
       ((H1 socrates) ;; (==> (man socrates) (mortal socrates))
        H2)))
 
 ;; ^^^ Was Aristotle right? ^^^
 
 (==> (∀ [t Thing]
        (==> (man t) (mortal t)))
      (man socrates)
      ;; thus
      (mortal socrates)))



;;; # Entracte ...

;;; ## What we learned thus far ...

;;; ... that thanks to the Curry-Howard correspondence
;;; a lambda-calculus with dependent types may be used to:

;;;   1) express logical <<<propositions as types|||(lambda(x)t)>>>

;;;   2) formalize <<<proofs as terms|||(lambda(x)t)>>> carrying those types

;;; ## However ...

;;;   working directly with proofs-as-terms is cumbersome

;;;   and better <<<abstractions|||t>>> are required

;;; ---> so let's introduce the <<<LaTTe proof assistant|||t>>>



;;; # The LaTTe proof assistant

;;; ## Proof assistant
;;; a tool that allows to formulate mathematical content on
;;; a computer, and assists in the mathematician's routine: proving things!


;;; ## About LaTTe
;;; LaTTe is a proof assistant implemented as a Clojure library
;;; with top-level forms for axioms, definitions, theorems and proofs.
;; available on Clojars: <<<[latte "0.3.7-SNAPSHOT"]|||(lambda (x) t)>>>

;;; ## Notable features

;;; - any Clojure Development environment can be used to do maths!
;; (e.g. I use both Cider and Gorilla Repl, sometimes together via nrepl...)

;;; - it leverages the Clojure (Clojars) ecosystem for <<<proving in the large|||t>>>

;;; - it supports a DSL for declarative proof scripts <<<<-- hot!|||t>>>



;;; # Let's do the maths...

;;; ### Our objectives (in the few minutes to come):

;;; 1) a bit of logic: <<<natural deduction|||(lambda (x) t)>>>

;;; 2) a taste of "real" mathematics: <<<injectivity|||(lambda (x) t)>>>



;;; # 1) a bit of logic: Natural Deduction

;;; A simple characterization of (most) logical constructions
;;; based on <<<introduction rules|||(lambda (x)t)>>>
;; (how to construct?)
;;; and <<<elimination rules|||(lambda (x)t)>>>
;; (how to destruct?)

;;; ## Example: conjunction

;;; ### Introduction rule

;;;      A      B
;;;   ============== (and-intro)
;;;      (and A B)

;;; ### Elimination rules

;;;     (and A B)                         (and A B)
;;;  ============== (and-elim-left)    ============== (and-elim-right)
;;;        A                                 B



;;; # Conjunction in Type Theory (1/2)

;;; First a somewhat cryptic definition:

(definition and-  ;; nameclash!
  "Conjunction in Type Theory"
  [[A :type] [B :type]]
  (∀ [C :type]
    (==> (==> A B C)
         C)))

;;; Then the introduction rule: 

;;;      A      B
;;;   ============== (and-intro)
;;;      (and A B)

(defthm and-intro- ""
  [[A :type] [B :type]]
  (==> A B
       (and- A B)))

(proof 'and-intro-
    :term
  '(λ [x A]
     (λ [y B]
        (λ [C :type]
           (λ [f (==> A B C)]
              ((f x) y))))))



;;; # Conjunction in Type Theory (2/2)

;;; Finally the elimination rules

;;;     (and A B)                         (and A B)
;;;  ============== (and-elim-left)    ============== (and-elim-right)
;;;        A                                 B

(defthm and-elim-left- ""
  [[A :type] [B :type]]
   (==> (and- A B)
        A))

(proof 'and-elim-left-
    :script
  "Our hypothesis"     
  (assume [p (and- A B)]

    (have <c> A :by (<a> <b>)))
  (qed <c>))

;; exercice : and-elim-right-  (solution? p/and-elim-right)



;;; # Conjunction as computation (in Clojure)

;; We have:
;; intro in Latte: (λ [x A] (λ [y B] (λ [C :type] (λ [f (==> A B C)] ((f x) y))))
(def intro (fn [x] (fn [y] (fn [f] ((f x) y)))))

;; elim-left: (λ [p (and- A B)] ((p A) (λ [x A] (λ [y B] x))))

;; elim-left: (λ [p (and- A B)] ((p B) (λ [x A] (λ [y B] y))))
(def right (fn [p] (p (fn [x] (fn [y] y)))))

;; Have these functions any computational meaning?

(def p ((intro "hello") 42))
(left p)
(right p)



;;; # 2) A taste of "real" mathematics
;;; ## Injectivity

(definition injective
  "A function f is injective iff for ∀x,y, f(x)=f(y) ⟹ x=y."
  [[T :type] [U :type] [f (==> T U)]]

  [[T :type] [U :type] [V :type] [f (==> U V)] [g (==> T U)]]
  (==> (injective U V f)
       (injective T U g)
       (injective T V (λ [x T] (f (g x))))))

(proof 'compose-injective
    :script
  "Our hypothesis is that f and g are injective."
  (assume [Hf (injective U V f)
           Hg (injective T U g)]
    "We then have to prove that the composition is injective."

    "For this we consider two arbitrary elements x and y
 such that f(g(x)) = f(g(y))"
    (assume [x T
             y T
             Hxy (equal (f (g x)) (f (g y)))]
      
      "Since f is injective we have: g(x) = g(y)."
      (have <a> (equal (g x) (g y))
            :by (Hf (g x) (g y) Hxy))
      
      "And since g is also injective we obtain: x = y."
      (have <b> (equal x y)
            :by (Hg x y <a>)))
      
    "Since x and y are arbitrary, f°g is thus injective."
    (have <c> (injective T V (λ [x T] (f (g x)))) :by <b>))
  (qed <c>))




;;; # Aftermath ...

;;; ### Mathematics can be fun, (almost) as fun as live-coding in Clojure!
;; but ... wait! this *is* live-coding in Clojure!

;;; Formalizing and proving things can be a very addictive <<<puzzle game|||(lambda (x) t)>>> with:

;;; - Relatively simple rules: a lambda-calculus with explicit (dependent) types

;;; - An almighty adversary: <<<mathematics|||(lambda(x)t)>>>

;;; - An <<<unlimited|||(lambda(x)t)>>> number of puzzles:

;;;    * starters: propositional logic, basic quantifiers, etc.

;;;    * serious challenges: numbers, inductive types, recursive functions, etc.
;;    (way more captivating than Sudoku and even kakuro)

;;;    * professional-grade puzzles: modern mathematics
;; (new puzzles invented everyday...)
